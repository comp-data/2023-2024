# Supposing that all the classes developed for the project
# are contained in the file 'impl.py', then:

# 1) Importing all the classes for handling the relational database
from impl import ProcessDataUploadHandler, ProcessDataQueryHandler

# 2) Importing all the classes for handling graph database
from impl import MetadataUploadHandler, MetadataQueryHandler

# 3) Importing the class for dealing with mashup queries
from impl import AdvancedMashup

# Once all the classes are imported, first create the relational
# database using the related source data
rel_path = "relational.db"
process = ProcessDataUploadHandler()
process.setDbPathOrUrl(rel_path)
process.pushDataToDb("data/process.json")
# Please remember that one could, in principle, push one or more files
# calling the method one or more times (even calling the method twice
# specifying the same file!)

# Then, create the graph database (remember first to run the
# Blazegraph instance) using the related source data
grp_endpoint = "http://127.0.0.1:9999/blazegraph/sparql"
metadata = MetadataUploadHandler()
metadata.setDbPathOrUrl(grp_endpoint)
metadata.pushDataToDb("data/meta.csv")
# Please remember that one could, in principle, push one or more files
# calling the method one or more times (even calling the method twice
# specifying the same file!)

# In the next passage, create the query handlers for both
# the databases, using the related classes
process_qh = ProcessDataQueryHandler()
process_qh.setDbPathOrUrl(rel_path)

metadata_qh = MetadataQueryHandler()
metadata_qh.setDbPathOrUrl(grp_endpoint)

# Finally, create a advanced mashup object for asking
# about data
mashup = AdvancedMashup()
mashup.addProcessHandler(process_qh)
mashup.addMetadataHandler(metadata_qh)

result_q1 = mashup.getAllActivities()
result_q2 = mashup.getAuthorsOfCulturalHeritageObject("1")
result_q3 = mashup.getAuthorsOfObjectsAcquiredInTimeFrame("2023-04-01", "2023-05-01")
