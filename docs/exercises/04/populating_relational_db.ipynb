    "# Library Database Management\n",
    "\n",
    "This project involves the creation and management of a library database using data from bibliographic resources and publishers. The goal is to organize the information in a relational database, allowing for efficient data retrieval and management.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The data consists of two primary entities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `BibliographicResource`: Represents the bibliographic information of various resources.\n",
    "2. `Publisher`: Represents the publishers of these resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between these entities is established through the `Publisher`'s ID, which is used to link each `BibliographicResource` with its respective `Publisher`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Classes Diagram](classes_diagram.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Description of the Data Files\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `data.csv` File\n",
    "\n",
    "The `data.csv` file contains bibliographic information with the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `id`: A unique identifier for each bibliographic entry, typically formatted as a digital object identifier (DOI).\n",
    "- `title`: The title of the work, which can range from research papers to datasets.\n",
    "- `type`: The type of the resource, such as 'dataset', indicating the kind of material the bibliographic entry represents.\n",
    "- `publisher`: An identifier linking the resource to its publisher, prefixed with 'crossref:' followed by a numerical identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a snippet of what the data looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "| id | title | type | publisher |\n",
    "|----|-------|------|-----------|\n",
    "| doi:10.1037/e383822004-001 | Persistence And Change: Standards-Based Systemic... | dataset | crossref:15 |\n",
    "| doi:10.1037/e531662006-001 | BIA And DOD Schools: Student Achievement And Oth... | dataset | crossref:15 |\n",
    "| doi:10.1037/e596722007-001 | Drugs, Brains, And Behavior: The Science Of Addi... | dataset | crossref:15 |\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `publishers.csv` File\n",
    "\n",
    "The `publishers.csv` file lists publishers, providing their unique identifiers and names. Each publisher is associated with the bibliographic entries from the `data.csv` file through the `id` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "| id | name |\n",
    "|----|------|\n",
    "| crossref:15 | American Psychological Association (APA) |\n",
    "| crossref:320 | Association For Computing Machinery (ACM) |\n",
    "| crossref:263 | Institute Of Electrical And Electronics... |\n",

    "## Exercise 1: Creating the DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Use Pandas to create two separate DataFrames: one for `BibliographicResource` and one for `Publisher` with manually created unique IDs for each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the `data.csv` file into a DataFrame named `bibliographic_df`. This file contains information on bibliographic resources.\n",
    "2. Read the `publishers.csv` file into a DataFrame named `publishers_df`. This file contains information on publishers.\n",
    "3. Manually create a unique identifier for each row in both DataFrames using the pattern `biblio-<index>` for BibliographicResource and `publisher-<index>` for Publisher.\n",
    "4. Add these unique identifiers as a new column in each DataFrame.\n",
    "5. Print the first five rows of each DataFrame to verify the presence of unique IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2: Merging DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Merge the `BibliographicResource` and `Publisher` DataFrames into a single DataFrame, ensuring that the relationship between the resources and publishers is maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Merge `bibliographic_df` and `publishers_df` on the `Publisher` `id` field. The resulting DataFrame should have the bibliographic information along with the name of the publisher.\n",
    "2. Ensure that all `BibliographicResource` entries have the `Publisher`'s name included in the merged DataFrame.\n",
    "3. Print the first five rows of the merged DataFrame to verify your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 3: Connecting to SQLite and Creating the Database\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Establish a connection to a SQLite database and create the tables `BibliographicResource` and `Publisher` based on the structure of the provided DataFrames and UML diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use Python's `sqlite3` library to establish a connection to a new SQLite database called `library.db`.\n",
    "2. Create a `BibliographicResource` table with appropriate columns based on the `bibliographic_df` DataFrame and the UML diagram.\n",
    "3. Create a `Publisher` table with appropriate columns based on the publishers_df DataFrame and the UML diagram.\n",
    "4. Close the database connection.\n",
